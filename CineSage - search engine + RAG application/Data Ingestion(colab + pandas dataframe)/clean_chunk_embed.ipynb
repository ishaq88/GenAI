at the turn\\r\\nof the century.\\r\\n\\r\\n249\\r\\n00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,274\\r\\nSo she goes way, way back.\\r\\n\\r\\n250\\r\\n00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,283\\r\\nAnd I think, by 1916, she was\\r\\njust getting impatient, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n251\\r\\n00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,685\\r\\nThe movement seems to be listing\\r\\n\\r\\n252\\r\\n00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,551\\r\\nand there's a great sense\\r\\nof frustration,\\r\\n\\r\\n253\\r\\n00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,629\\r\\nand the National Association\\r\\ndrafts Carrie Catt\\r\\n\\r\\n254\\r\\n00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,028\\r\\nto come back and lead them\\r\\n\\r\\n255\\r\\n00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,624\\r\\ninto what they know is going\\r\\nto be a critical stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n256\\r\\n00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,705\\r\\nAfter the

really very enticing.\\r\\n\\r\\n267\\r\\n00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,230\\r\\nBut it's not easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n268\\r\\n00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,703\\r\\nYou have to get two-thirds\\r\\nof the

amendment.\\r\\n\\r\\n374\\r\\n00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,051\\r\\nShe does the math and says,\\r\\n\\\"Okay, clearly,\\r\\n\\r\\n375\\r\\n00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:32,097\\r\\n\\\"the more

ignoring them,\\r\\n\\r\\n1078\\r\\n00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,628\\r\\nbut you know he was peeking\\r\\nthrough the curtains\\r\\n\\r\\n1079\\r\\n00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:05,466\\r\\nto see what they were up to.\\r\\n\\r\\n1080\\r\\n00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:08,238\\r\\nSomething has to be done,\\r\\nand it's very difficult,\\r\\n\\r\\n1081\\r\\n00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,042\\r\\nbecause nothing the

00:59:24,593\\r\\nThe district police\\r\\nmoved quickly\\r\\n\\r\\n1086\\r\\n00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,994\\r\\nto shut the vigil down.\\r\\n\\r\\n1087\\r\\n00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,760\\r\\nAt first, pickets were arrested\\r\\nwhen they reached their posts,\\r\\n\\r\\n1088\\r\\n00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,095\\r\\nspuriously charged\\r\\nwith obstructing

01:00:10,033\\r\\nThe kind of women\\r\\nwho were on the picket lines\\r\\n\\r\\n1101\\r\\n01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:14,269\\r\\nwere generally white,\\r\\nmiddle-class

been\\r\\nincomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n1104\\r\\n01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,781\\r\\nBut a lot of them, I think,\\r\\njust decided\\r\\n\\r\\n1105\\r\\n01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,644\\r\\nthis was something they felt\\r\\nthey had to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n1106\\r\\n01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,313\\r\\nThey were coming\\r\\nfrom a great distance,\\r\\n\\r\\n1107\\r\\n01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,584\\r\\nmany of them without telling\\r\\ntheir families\\r\\n\\r\\n1108\\r\\n01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,456\\r\\nwhat they were going to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n1109\\r\\n01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:36,363\\r\\nSo, it galvanized the troops\\r\\naround Alice Paul.\\r\\n\\r\\n1110\\r\\n01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,063\\r\\nShe had this single-minded\\r\\nquality of commitment,\\r\\n\\r\\n1111\\r\\n01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,648\\r\\nbelieving that anything\\r\\ncould be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n1112\\r\\n01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,334\\r\\nThere were no obstacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n1113\\r\\n01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,069\\r\\nAnd so she called out the best\\r\\nin them.\\r\\n\\r\\n1114\\r\\n01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,443\\r\\nShe insisted that they do what\\r\\nwas necessary, and they did.\\r\\n\\r\\n1115\\r\\n01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:56,212\\r\\nAnd once that decision was made,\\r\\nnothing would stop them.\\r\\n\\r\\n1116\\r\\n01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,685\\r\\nAs soon as they're out of jail,\\r\\n\\r\\n1117\\r\\n01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:03,453\\r\\nthey're back out on\\r\\nthe picket line the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n1118\\r\\n01:01:03,593 -->

policy\\r\\nto engage in\\r\\n\\r\\n1132\\r\\n01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,760\\r\\nand will hurt suffrage.\\r\\n\\r\\n1133\\r\\n01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:50,473\\r\\nCatt and the National

together,\\r\\n\\r\\n1517\\r\\n01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,770\\r\\nwhere the more militant wing\\r\\n\\r\\n1518\\r\\n01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:30,204\\r\\nis really pushing things forward\\r\\nand
